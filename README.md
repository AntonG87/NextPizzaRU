# 🍕 NextPizza – Fullstack Pizza Ordering App

Welcome to **NextPizza**, a modern and full-featured pizza ordering application built with:

- **Next.js 13 App Router**
- **TypeScript**
- **Prisma (ORM)**
- **NextAuth.js (Authentication)**
- **Tailwind CSS**

---

## 🧾 About the Project

This project was originally built while following a 24-hour Russian-language course on YouTube. I actively coded along for the first half and later continued by analyzing the structure and key features on my own, such as authentication and database integration. Many parts were improved or refactored into my own style and ideas.

It became my main **pet project**, where I practiced building a scalable fullstack app with a clean architecture.

> The original version was developed in a **private repository**. For transparency, I uploaded the final version to this public repo. That's why all commits appear close in time.

This project was inspired by a YouTube course but heavily adapted, modified, and expanded independently to serve as a showcase of fullstack skills using the modern Next.js stack.
